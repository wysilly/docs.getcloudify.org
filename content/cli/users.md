The `cfy users` command is used to manage users and passwords on Cloudify Manager.<br>
If you choose not to integrate Cloudify Manager with LDAP/AD, you must add each user individually and set a password for them. You can also create groups and add users to them. The users and user groups can be assigned to one or more tenants.

#### Requirements

* To use the command you must have Cloudify `admin` credentials.<br>
* User names and passwords must conform to the following requirements:  

  * Minimum number of characters - 5
  * Maximum number of characters - 255
  * Valid characters are alphanumeric, or `-`, `_`, or `.`.
  * Value must begin with a letter
  * Cannot be empty

#### Optional flags

These will work on each command:

* `-v, --verbose` - Show verbose output. You can supply this up to three times (i.e. -vvv)
* `-h, --help` - Show this message and exit.
